                If you are in the EEA, the UK or Switzerland, you have the right
                to request access and receive information about the Personal
                Information we maintain about you, to update and correct
                inaccuracies in your Personal Information, to restrict or object
                to the processing of your Personal Information, to have the
                information blocked, anonymized, or deleted, as appropriate, or
                to exercise your right to data portability to easily transfer
                your Personal Information to another company. Those rights may
                be limited in some circumstances by local law requirements. In
                addition to the above-mentioned rights, you also have the right
                to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office
                in the UK or the data protection supervisory authority in the EU
                country in which you live or work, or where you believe we have

                lawfulness of the processing before your consent withdrawal.
                Please note that we may have valid legal reasons to refuse your
                request and will inform you if that is the case. For more

            <p>
                We take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep it
                in a form that does not allow you to be identified when this
                information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we
                process it, unless we are required by law to keep this
                information for a longer period. When determining the retention
                period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type
                of services requested by or provided to you, the nature and
                length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrollment with
                our services, the impact on the services we provide to you if we
                delete some information from or about you, mandatory retention
                periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.
