      1. What is a ScratchJr Family Day?
    </div>


    <div class="content-section-item-description left-align">
      <p>ScratchJr Family Day is a community event where parents, grandparents, siblings, extended family members, and children can work together to create projects in ScratchJr!
      The goal of Family Day is not only to help adults and children feel more comfortable using ScratchJr, but also to encourage collaboration between adults and children while
      creating ScratchJr projects.</p>

        <h3>Guidelines for Family Recruitment</h3>


        <p>Now that you are planning to host a ScratchJr Family Day in your community, we'd like to provide a few recommendations for recruiting families to attend. We advise
        facilitators to recruit family participants from their respective community to come for a family coding event, through social media posts, email, or flyers. Recruiting
        materials should have the following points of information about the event:</p>


        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Date, time, and location of event</li>


          <li>Description of the ScratchJr programming app: &quot;A free tablet app, developed by the DevTech Research Group at Tufts University and the Lifelong Kindergarten Group
          at MIT, that allows young children to program their own interactive stories and games, teaching problem solving, coding, creativity, collaboration, and more.&quot;</li>


          <li>An event tagline such as: &quot;Families can collaborate to learn programming and new technologies together! Join [name of institution] for a family coding event with
          the ScratchJr programming app on [date] at [time].&quot;</li>


          <li>Indication that this event is for children ages 5-7 (or in kindergarten through second grade) and their families - can include siblings, parents, grandparents,
          etc.</li>


          <li>Attendees have the option to provide feedback about the event structure and content for DevTech Research Group team at Tufts University, who is conducting a study on
          the facilitation of family collaboration around programming and technology. Participation in the study is not mandatory to attend the Family Day event.</li>


          <li>Instructions for bringing tablets, or note that institution will provide tablets to borrow, depending on capability of institution.</li>


          <li>Instructions for signing up to RSVP for event (i.e. Google form, email address, sign up sheet)</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Facilitator Script</h3>


        <p>Once families have arrived at your event, we ask that you state the following facilitator script for study recruitment, emphasizing that participation in the research
        part of the event is voluntary:</p>


        <p><em>"Hello everyone, and welcome to our ScratchJr Family Day programming event! We're so happy you're all joining us today to learn more about technology and programming
        collaborative with ScratchJr. ScratchJr is a programming app for young children, developed by the DevTech Research Group at Tufts University, and the Lifelong Kindergarten
        Group at MIT. We are hosting this family outreach coding event by the DevTech group at Tufts, so they can better understand how families learn about programming and
        technologies together. If you would like to be participants in this study run by DevTech, we will provide you with 2 short surveys: one at the beginning, and one at the end
        of this event, as a chance for you to give their team feedback on your experience coding with the app as a family. Should you choose not to participate in the study, that
        is okay, and we will not provide you with the surveys. The pre-event survey will take approximately 5 minutes, and the post-event survey will take approximately 10-15
        minutes to complete before you leave here today, if your family chooses to participate and provide the creators of ScratchJr with feedback about this event. Additionally,
        one of our facilitators will be going around taking photographs. These may be used for promotional and/or educational purposes. If you would not like to be photographed,
        please let me know now."</em>
        </p>


        <h3>Photographs</h3>


        <p>If families to not wish to be photographed, they should tell you (or other designated facilitator) at the beginning of the event. We recommend giving those family
        members a sticker or some sort of signifier that they do not wish to be photographed. Therefore, facilitators should know which attendees do not wish to be photographed,
        and should be sure to not include them in photos. After the event, study coordinators will share you on a file storage drive so you can upload all other photographs from
        the event of consenting participants.</p>

        <div class="print-br">
          <br><br><br><br><br>
        </div>

        <h3>Surveys</h3>


        <p>Information about the event and opportunity to consent to participation are all included in the survey links below. Once a legal guardian or facilitator reads through
        the information in the pre-survey and selects "Yes" to consent to participating, they will take the survey. If they select "No" at this point, they will be taken to the end
        of the survey. Please note: if families DO wish to participate, we ask that they complete both the pre-event survey AND the post-event survey to get a complete look at
        their experiences.</p>


        <ol>
          <li>Family Pre-Event Survey through Qualtrics: <a href="http://bit.ly/SJFamilyPreSurvey" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/SJFamilyPreSurvey</a> - We ask that at least 1 legal
          guardian of the children attending fill out this pre-survey when they arrive at the event on their device on behalf of the family, if they choose to participate.
          Participation in this study is completely voluntary. Families are welcome to attend the event and not participate.
          </li>


          <li>Family Post-Event Survey through Qualtrics: <a href="http://bit.ly/SJFamilyPostSurvey" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/SJFamilyPostSurvey</a> - We ask that the same
          llegal guardian(s) of the children attending who filled out the pre-event survey fill out this survey at the end of the event on their device on behalf of the family. We
          ask that all families who filled out pre-surveys also fill out the post-survey for best reserach results.
          </li>


          <li>Facilitator Post-Event Survey through Qualtrics: <a href="http://bit.ly/SJFacilitatorPostSurvey" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/SJFacilitatorPostSurvey</a> - We ask that at least 1
          facilitator at our event completes this survey within 48 hours of the end of the event. Ideally, we would like all facilitators to participate for more feedback, but we
          only require 1.

      <div class="content-section-item-description full-extend left-align">
        <p>This event can be run with any number of families. We recommend each event have at least 3 facilitators, and that they be familiar with ScratchJr and comfortable
        teaching others how to use it. Generally, one device is advised per family. However, if there are multiple children within the ScratchJr age range (5-7), it may be
        worthwhile to have a second device available. Remember, the goal is to make sure that adults are able to work with their children (rather than having children working on
        their own).</p>

      7. Family Coding Activities
    </div>


    <div class="content-section-item-description left-align">
      <p>Here are three activity ideas for families to get started on their own ScratchJr projects during the “Family Coding” portion of the event. Remember, throughout the event,
      families should be encouraged to create only one project together (rather than multiple projects). These activity prompts are meant to inspire families, but do encourage
      families to go “outside the box” instead of being confined by the prompts. You, as the event host, are also encouraged to create your own activities that may be more
      relevant to your own community. These activities are also included in "Section 10: Handouts" of the packet so they can be printed out and displayed for families to see.</p>



      <ol>
        <li><strong>Fairy Tale:</strong> Create a fairy tale, starring your family members! Who will be the villain, and who will save the day? It may be helpful to add new pages
        to create your story!</li>


        <li><strong>Family Race:</strong> Who runs the fastest in your family? Can you create a race between two members of your family in ScratchJr? The “Speed” block may be
        helpful for this challenge!</li>


        <li><strong>Family Vacation:</strong> Where is your favorite place to visit as a family? Is it the park, a chocolate factory, the beach, or a vacation that you went on?
        Tell a story using ScratchJr to share about this favorite place.</li>

        8. Tips for Effective Facilitation
      </div>

      <div>

      </div>

      <div class="content-section-item-description left-align">
        Below are some helpful tips for facilitators.


        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>The schedule was designed so that there is a separate, facilitated introduction to ScratchJr for adults and for children. This was specifically done because adults and
          children need different scaffolds to get started and feel comfortable. In the adult session, it is helpful to have a hands-on introduction where parents can follow along
          in ScratchJr on their own devices. Additionally, providing any tips for how to use ScratchJr or ways to encourage collaboration between adults and children could be
          helpful. In the child session, it is helpful to start with a warm-up game so that children can get to know the facilitators as well as the other children. Additionally,
          introducing and explaining the word “programming,” as well as the types of projects that they can create in ScratchJr will help them get acclimated.</li>


          <li>During the adult introduction as well as throughout the event, remind adults that this event is designed for adults and children to work collaboratively in
          ScratchJr!</li>


          <li>If desired, provide alterative, off-screen activities for siblings who may not be as engaged in ScratchJr. Ideas for activities include ScratchJr coloring pages (see
          Section 10), picture books, and drawing/craft materials.</li>


          <li>Family Share Time: During the “Family Share Time,” an easy way to pair up families is to hand out index cards with one color on them. Have families find their matching
          color, and that is their partner.</li>


          <li>Room Set-Up: Have ample spaces set up for families to work together. This can be at a table, on the floor/rug, or wherever else they may feel the most comfortable. It
          is important for there to places where families can work by themselves as well as in pairs.</li>


          <li>If desired, you can have paper and markers available to families if they want to plan their ScratchJr projects off-screen first.</li>


          <li>Foster a learning environment of asking questions rather than always providing answers.</li>


          <li>Encourage exploration, experimentation, and risk-taking! Encourage participants to move out of their comfort zones to try new concepts.</li>


          <li>Remind families that this event is not about producing a final product; instead, it is about sharing the joy of programming and having a fun experience as a
          family!</li>

      <div class="content-section-item-description left-align">
        Drag each block that you would like to use down into the programming area. Notice the shape of the blocks--they look like puzzle pieces. By dragging the blocks next to one
        another, they will automatically snap together, creating one straight sequence.

        <p>Remember, you can give every character a program if you’d like. To go between characters, simply tap on the character you would like to program on the left side of the
        screen and make sure it is highlighted in orange. Then, add the desired programming blocks.</p>

        your program, and this will “turn the page” for you.
